In order to build you need a fullfill a few dependencies. You need to download
Jinja2 from pypi and build an egg file by doing:
python26 setup.py bdist_egg --exclude-source-files

A file named: Jinja2-<version>-py2.6.egg will be generated for you in dist, copy
it to the deps folder.

You also need twisted-r1 and zope-r1 from Py4A project. Change the extension to
egg and put them into deps as well.
